Avid knitter, spider diagram junkie and lover of lists. One can never have too many lists.  

1. ¬†Hundertwasser and Ada Lovelace are held in my highest regards.

2. Pastimes include animation and quadratic equations.

3. Obsessed with code. Particularly partial to Javascript promises.

Oh, and I have an ability¬†to fit into very small spaces if needs be. Desks, cardboard boxes and car boots included.  P.S All hail the humble Helvetica.

## Skills

#### Creative problem-solver
Whilst I live and breathe everything arty farty, I am equally attracted to order, numbers and logic. Problem-solving gets me giddy with excitement and essentially this is what coding is all about, right? Creative problem-solving.

My background in the arts has trained my visual reasoning. In breaking down and tackling a problem, I draw diagrams to visualise the process, translating the abstract into something solid and tangible. Take a look at my blog [**Ode To Yoda (and code)**] (https://odetoyoda.wordpress.com/), in which I convert (sometimes) confusing code concepts encountered on my Makers Academy journey into doodles. Never sans sketchbook, this skill has been invaluable whilst learning to code.

#### Spinner of Many Plates
A big part of a Producer's role is the juggling of many jobs at one time. At [**BBH**] (http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/) I had to manage people (from partners to cameramen on set), budgets, teams and deadlines. Similarly, at [**Tibor**] (http://www.tibor.co.uk/), a very early-stage start-up, my role would consist of weekly reports with the investors, coordinating our upcoming exhibition at the [**Whitworth**] (http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/), as well as producing a book with the V&A and re-designing our website. Phew! Through this, attention to detail, meticulous organisation and efficiency have become core values that are important drivers for me.

#### T-E-A-M Player
Pair programming. Retrospectives. Team Projects. Stand-ups. These are principles which were ingrained into our very being at Makers Academy. Bouncing ideas, approaches and perspectives off people with different brains is what makes me really tick in a team. This is particularly true of creative teams when you collaborate together to deliver a coherent, successful advertising campaign, as I did at BBH with Virgin Media and British Airways. Working with many personalities and egos chucked into the mix requires a clear and concise level of communication and team spirit!

#### Left-Handed
Nuff said.

### Spinning plates of logic and imagination on my left hand. I believe this is a deadly combination to take over the world/get a job.
