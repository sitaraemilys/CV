Avid knitter, spider diagram junkie and lover of lists. One can never have too many lists.¬†Hundertwasser and Ada Lovelace are held in my highest regards. Pastimes include animation and quadratic equations. Oh, and I have an ability¬†to fit into very small spaces if needs be. Desks, cardboard boxes and car boots included.

## Skills

#### Creative problem-solver
Whilst I live and breathe everything arty farty, I am equally attracted to order, numbers and logic. Problem-solving gets me giddy with excitement and essentially this is what coding is all about, right? Creative problem-solving.

I break a problem down into lots of little ones. I draw diagrams to visualise these problems, translating the abstract into something solid and tangible. I believe my background in the arts has trained my visual reasoning, and, in turn, helped me to create beautiful, clean code. INSERT PICTURE?

My process in breaking down a large problem into lots of little problems. Next, I draw a diagram that depicts these problems, visualising the abstract into something solid and tangible.



I believe my appreciation of visual aesthetics helps me to create beautiful and clean code.

Never sans sketchbook, this skill has been invaluable whilst learning to code.

<!-- I like logic. A lot. Give me a juicy problem to sink my teeth into.  -->

<!-- seemingly insurmountable new challenges can be broken down and tackled one at a time. -->

#### Spinner of Many Plates
Organisation are values that guide me through life
My attention to detail was key in this. Lose track of one plate. And they all go.

I pride myself on being the ultimate multi-tasker. A big part of a Producer's role is the juggling of many jobs at one time. Whilst recording a British Airways radio spot, I was in pre-production meetings with directors for a Virgin Media TV advert as well as negotiating with the client for a Surf animation. Phew!

Through this,

flexibility, resourcefulness and versatility have become engrained in my personality, and are reflected in all choices I make, and values I live by.

#### Left-Handed
Nuff said.

### Spinning plates of logic and imagination on my left hand. I think this is a deadly combination to take over the world/get a job.

- Dadaism, Surrealism, Modernism, Post-Modernism and the sexualization of Jesus Christ's wounds
- Year Abroad in Florence, in which, apart from falling in love with the pappardelle pasta, the people and the Ponte Vecchio, I explored the mutually enriching relationship between art and science. I was drawn to the analysis of cultural traffic between artistic production and scientific imagery, personified in Da Vinci.
- Dissertation prize for my essay in which I explored the 'third gender' in Claude Cahun's oeuvre in 1920's bohemian Paris

#### Latymer Upper School (2006 - 2009)
##### A Levels

#### Things that make me tick

Opera singing, collage creating, nature documentaries, cooking food which name I can't pronounce, surfing badly, magical surrealism literature, particularly Murakami.
