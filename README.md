Avid knitter, spider diagram junkie and lover of lists. One can never have too many lists. Hundertwasser/Frida Kahlo and Ada Lovelace are held in my highest regards. Pastimes include animation and quadratic equations. Oh, and I have an ability to fit into very small spaces if needs be. Desks, cardboard boxes and car boots included.

## Skills

#### Analytical
I like logic. A lot.

#### Creative (shall i include this?)
In awe of code as an art form.

### Creative problem solving. Combining the harmony of imagination with logistics, I think this is a deadly combination to take on the world/ get a job.
