Avid knitter, spider diagram junkie and lover of lists. One can never have too many lists. Hundertwasser/Frida Kahlo and Ada Lovelace are held in my highest regards. Pastimes include animation and quadratic equations. Oh, and I have an ability to fit into very small spaces if needs be. Desks, cardboard boxes and car boots included.
