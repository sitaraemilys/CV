Avid knitter, spider diagram junkie and lover of lists. One can never have too many lists.Â Hundertwasser/Frida Kahlo and Ada Lovelace are held in my highest regards. Pastimes include animation and quadratic equations. Oh, and I have an abilityÂ to fit into very small spaces if needs be. Desks, cardboard boxes and car boots included. (something about code...?)

## Skills

#### Analytical
I like logic. A lot.   
Get a problem. Recognise the problem. Break it down in lots of little problems. Draw some diagrams that depict these problems, normally with arrows. ðŸ’¡

#### Creative (shall i include this?)
In awe of code as an art form.    

#### Left Handed
Nuff said.

### Creative problem solving. Combining the harmony of imagination with logistics, I think this is a deadly combination to take on the world/ get a job.
